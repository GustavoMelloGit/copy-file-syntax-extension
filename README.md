## Setting up a Keyboard Shortcut

To optimize your experience with the "File Syntax: Copy Code With Highlight!" extension, we recommend configuring a custom keyboard shortcut to activate the extension's command. Here's a step-by-step guide to assist you in setting it up:

1. **Open Keyboard Shortcuts**: Launch Visual Studio Code and access the Keyboard Shortcuts settings. You can do this by following these steps:

   - On Windows/Linux: Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Keyboard Shortcuts`.
   - On macOS: Navigate to `Code` > `Settings` > `Keyboard Shortcuts`.

2. **Locate the Extension Command**: In the Keyboard Shortcuts search bar, type "File Syntax: Copy Code With Highlight!" to find the command provided by your extension.

3. **Assign the Recommended Keyboard Shortcut**: When you identify the extension's command, you'll see an associated pencil icon. Click on it to open the keybinding editor for that command.

4. **Configure the Shortcut**: In the keybinding editor, there will be a field to input your chosen keyboard shortcut. We strongly recommend using the `Ctrl+Shift+C` combination for its familiarity and ease of use.

5. **Save and Apply**: After entering the keyboard shortcut, simply save your changes. Your newly created key binding will be applied automatically.

Now, whenever you employ the `Ctrl+Shift+C` keyboard shortcut, the command will be triggered, allowing you to effortlessly copy highlighted code!
